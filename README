PHYSICALLY BASED COMPUTER ANIMATION FINAL PROJECT
******************************************************************************* 

Things done so far:
	- Convert .wav files into simple float amplitudes
	- Figured out how to use FFTW to take the fourier transform of music 
		data
	- Taking the fourier transform of the entire piece of music (FINISHED)
	
Doing now:
	- Have to figure out how to space out the music input file

Have to do:
	- Have to figure out how to use the fourier transform data and append
		the view with it.
